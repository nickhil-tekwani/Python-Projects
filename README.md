# Python Projects
Some small python projects I did throughout coursework and for fun as I learned the basics of Python and Machine Learning. The projects are labeled as either an ML/Statistics related project, or another type of project (web scraping, game simulators, data viz, etc.) 

Projects (all are found in /Notebooks)
- COVID-19 Data Chloropleth (Other)
- Craps Simulator (Other)
